(Modified) UCETD LaTeX Class & Template
=======================================

This repository includes a LaTeX class and template for correctly formatted
electronic Ph.D. dissertations at the University of Chicago based on the
[original repo][original], which I've modified to use additional packages like
`geometry` and `hyperref` as well as switching bibliography generation to
`biblatex`.

The [official format specification][spec] can be tough to meet from scratch.
That's why we are providing this class and template. The class, when properly
used as in the template, will make sure your dissertation meets the spec.

As I have graduated and am no longer actively using this template, I don't have
time to support or maintain this package.
